# Zero-shot Prompting

## Input  
    Summarize the following Java method: 
            public Map < String , Integer > countWordFrequency ( List < String > words ) {
                Map < String , Integer > freqMap = new HashMap < >() ;
                for ( String word : words ) {
                    freqMap . put ( word , freqMap . getOrDefault ( word , 0) + 1) ;
                }
                return freqMap ;
            }

## Output
This Java method, `countWordFrequency`, takes a `List` of `String` objects as input and returns a `Map` where the keys are the unique words from the input list and the values are their corresponding frequencies (how many times each word appears in the list).

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1.  It initializes an empty `HashMap` called `freqMap` to store the word counts.
2.  It iterates through each `word` in the input `words` list.
3.  For each `word`, it checks if the word already exists as a key in the `freqMap`.
    * If the word exists, it retrieves the current count using `freqMap.get(word)`, increments it by 1, and updates the value associated with that word in the `freqMap`.
    * If the word doesn't exist, `freqMap.getOrDefault(word, 0)` returns 0 (the default value), which is then incremented to 1, and the word is added to the `freqMap` with a frequency of 1.
4.  Finally, after processing all the words, the method returns the `freqMap` containing the word frequencies.



# Role-Playing Prompting

## Input: 
    You are an expert Java Software developer, summarize the following Java method: 
            public Map < String , Integer > countWordFrequency ( List < String > words ) {
                Map < String , Integer > freqMap = new HashMap < >() ;
                for ( String word : words ) {
                    freqMap . put ( word , freqMap . getOrDefault ( word , 0) + 1) ;
                }
                return freqMap ;
            }

## Output
As a seasoned Java expert, I recognize this `countWordFrequency` method as a concise and efficient implementation for determining the occurrences of each unique word in a `List<String>`.

Internally, it employs a `HashMap` to store the word-frequency pairs. The method iterates through the input `words` list. For each `word`, it uses the `getOrDefault` method of the `HashMap` to retrieve the current count (or 0 if the word hasn't been encountered yet), increments it, and then updates the count for that `word` in the map. This approach avoids explicit checks for the existence of keys, resulting in cleaner and more performant code. The final `Map<String, Integer>` returned by the method provides a clear and readily usable representation of the frequency of each word in the original list. This is a standard and highly recommended pattern in Java for such tasks.
