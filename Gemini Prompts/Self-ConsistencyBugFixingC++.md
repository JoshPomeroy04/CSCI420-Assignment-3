# Zero-shot Prompting

## Input
    Resolve inconsistency between function name and logic:

    // Supposed to return true if x is even
    bool isOdd (int x ) {
        return x % 2 == 0; // Logic contradicts function name
    }¬†

## Output
Ah, I see the little puzzle you've presented! You're absolutely right, the function `isOdd` has logic that actually checks for even numbers.

Here are a couple of ways to resolve this inconsistency:

**1. Rename the function to accurately reflect its logic:**

```c++
// Returns true if x is even
bool isEven (int x ) {
  return x % 2 == 0;
}
```

This is often the simplest and clearest solution. By renaming the function to `isEven`, the code now reads exactly as it behaves, eliminating any potential confusion.

**2. Correct the logic to match the function name:**

```c++
// Returns true if x is odd
bool isOdd (int x ) {
  return x % 2 != 0; // or return x % 2 == 1;
}
```

In this approach, we modify the return statement to correctly check if the remainder when `x` is divided by 2 is not equal to 0 (or is equal to 1), which is the definition of an odd number.

Which approach is "better" often depends on the context of your code and what you intend the function to do. If the surrounding code expects a function that checks for even numbers, then renaming might be the way to go. If the intent is truly to check for odd numbers, then correcting the logic is the right choice.

Let me know if you have any other inconsistencies you'd like to resolve! üòä


# One-shot Prompting

## Input
    Bad function:
    bool isEven (int x ) {
        return x % 2 != 0; // or return x % 2 == 1;
    }
    Correct function:
    bool isOdd (int x ) {
        return x % 2 != 0; // or return x % 2 == 1;
    }

    Bad Function:
    bool isOdd (int x ) {
        return x % 2 == 0;
    }
    Correct Function:

## Output
You've got it! You're highlighting the importance of aligning function names with their actual behavior.

For the "Bad Function":

```c++
bool isOdd (int x ) {
 return x % 2 == 0;
}
```

The **Correct Function** would be:

```c++
bool isEven (int x ) {
 return x % 2 == 0;
}
```

By renaming the function to `isEven`, we accurately reflect that the code inside determines whether the input `x` is divisible by 2, which is the definition of an even number.

It's all about making the code as clear and self-documenting as possible through good naming! üëç
