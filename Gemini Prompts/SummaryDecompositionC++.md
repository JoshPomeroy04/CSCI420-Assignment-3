# Zero-shot Prompting

## Input
    Decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps:

    // Function that validates an input , calculates square , and returns result
    int process (int x ) {
    if ( x < 0) return -1;
        return x * x ;
    }

## Output
Okay, I can break down that high-level comment into logical steps based on the code:

1.  **Validate Input:** The function first checks if the input `x` meets a certain condition.
2.  **Conditional Return (Invalid):** If the input `x` is less than 0, the function immediately returns -1, indicating an invalid input.
3.  **Calculate Square (Valid):** If the input `x` is not less than 0 (meaning it's valid according to the condition), the function proceeds to calculate the square of `x`.
4.  **Return Result (Valid):** The function then returns the calculated square of `x`.

## Input 
    Step by step, decompose the high-level comment/summary into logical steps:

    // Function that validates an input , calculates square , and returns result
    int process (int x ) {
    if ( x < 0) return -1;
        return x * x ;
    }

## Output
Alright, let's break down that comment and code step by step:

1.  **Function Definition:** The code defines a function named `process` that takes one integer argument, which is named `x`. The function is declared to return an integer value (`int`).

2.  **Input Validation (Conditional Check):** Inside the `process` function, there's an `if` statement that checks a condition: "is `x` less than 0?".

3.  **Return Invalid Indicator:** If the condition in the `if` statement is true (i.e., if `x` is indeed less than 0), the function immediately executes the statement `return -1;`. This indicates that the input was not valid according to the function's criteria.

4.  **Calculate Square (Alternative Path):** If the condition in the `if` statement is false (i.e., if `x` is not less than 0), the code execution skips the `return -1;` statement and proceeds to the next line. This line calculates the square of `x` by multiplying `x` by itself (`x * x`).

5.  **Return Calculated Result:** Finally, the function executes the statement `return x * x;`, which returns the calculated square of the input `x`. This happens only when the initial validation check (`x < 0`) fails.

So, in essence, the function first checks if the input is non-negative. If it is, it computes and returns the square; otherwise, it returns a specific value (-1) to signal an invalid input.
