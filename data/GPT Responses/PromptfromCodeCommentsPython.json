    "R1": "Write a Python function called is_prime(n) that returns True if n is a prime number and False otherwise. The function should check if n is less than or equal to 1 (not prime), and for other values, it should check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of n. Include a comment explaining the purpose of the function.",
