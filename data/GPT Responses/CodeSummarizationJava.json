  "R1": "The countWordFrequency method takes a list of strings (words) and returns a map (Map<String, Integer>) that represents the frequency of each word in the list.\n\n\nSummary:\n- It initializes an empty HashMap to store word-frequency pairs.\n- For each word in the list:\n  - It increments the word’s count in the map, using getOrDefault to handle words not yet in the map.\n- Finally, it returns the map containing each word and its corresponding count.",
  "R2": "Method Summary: countWordFrequency\n\n\nThis method computes the frequency of each word in a given list.\n\nFunctionality:\n- Initializes a HashMap<String, Integer> to store word counts.\n- Iterates over the input list words.\n- For each word:\n  - Uses Map.getOrDefault() to retrieve the current count or default to 0 if the word is not present.\n  - Increments the count and updates the map.\n- Returns the populated frequency map.\n\n\nOutput:\nA Map<String, Integer> where each key is a unique word from the input list, and the corresponding value is the number of times that word appears.\n\n\nPerformance:\n- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.\n- Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of unique words.\n\n\nUse Case:\nUseful for text analysis, such as word counting, building term frequency models, or pre-processing steps in natural language processing (NLP) tasks."
