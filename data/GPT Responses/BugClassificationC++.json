    "R1": "The bug in the given C++ function is a \"Dangling Pointer\" bug. Here's the analysis:\n\nBug Type: Dangling Pointer / Use After Scope\n\n\nExplanation:\n- arr is a local variable allocated on the stack.\n- Once getArray() returns, the stack frame for this function is destroyed.\n- Therefore, the pointer arr becomes dangling-it points to memory that is no longer valid.\n- Any attempt to use the returned pointer leads to undefined behavior, such as crashes or corrupted data.",
    "R2": "Step-by-step Classification:\n\n\nStep 1: Understand the Declaration\n\n- This declares a local array named arr with size elements.\n- In C++, arrays declared this way inside functions are allocated on the stack.\n- The lifetime of arr is limited to the duration of the function call.\n\n\nType: Stack allocation (automatic storage duration)\n\n\nStep 2: Analyze the Return Statement\n\n- Here, arr decays to a pointer to its first element (i.e., int*).\n- However, since arr was a local stack variable, this pointer will refer to memory that no longer exists once the function ends.\n\n\nType: Returning pointer to a destroyed (out-of-scope) variable\n\nStep 3: Identify the Bug\n- After the function returns, arr’s memory is invalid.\n- Any access to the returned pointer leads to undefined behavior.\n\n\nBug Type:  \nDangling Pointer – a pointer that refers to a memory location that has been deallocated.\n\n\nStep 4: Result of the Bug\n- Undefined behavior: reading from or writing to the returned pointer may cause:\n  - Crashes\n  - Memory corruption\n  - Unexpected output\n\n\nFinal Classification:\n> Bug Type: Dangling Pointer\n> Cause: Returning a pointer to a local stack-allocated array that goes out of scope after function return."
