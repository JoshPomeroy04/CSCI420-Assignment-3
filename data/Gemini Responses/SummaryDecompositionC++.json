    "R1": "Okay, I can break down that high-level comment into logical steps based on the code:\n\n\n1.  Validate Input: The function first checks if the input x meets a certain condition.\n2.  Conditional Return (Invalid): If the input x is less than 0, the function immediately returns -1, indicating an invalid input.\n3.  Calculate Square (Valid): If the input x is not less than 0 (meaning it's valid according to the condition), the function proceeds to calculate the square of x.\n4.  Return Result (Valid): The function then returns the calculated square of x.",
    "R2": "Alright, let's break down that comment and code step by step:\n\n\n1.  Function Definition: The code defines a function named process that takes one integer argument, which is named x. The function is declared to return an integer value (int).\n\n\n2.  Input Validation (Conditional Check): Inside the process function, there's an if statement that checks a condition: \"is x less than 0?\".\n\n\n3.  Return Invalid Indicator: If the condition in the if statement is true (i.e., if x is indeed less than 0), the function immediately executes the statement return -1;. This indicates that the input was not valid according to the function's criteria.\n\n\n4.  Calculate Square (Alternative Path): If the condition in the if statement is false (i.e., if x is not less than 0), the code execution skips the return -1; statement and proceeds to the next line. This line calculates the square of x by multiplying x by itself (x * x).\n\n\n5.  Return Calculated Result: Finally, the function executes the statement return x * x;, which returns the calculated square of the input x. This happens only when the initial validation check (x < 0) fails.\n\n\nSo, in essence, the function first checks if the input is non-negative. If it is, it computes and returns the square; otherwise, it returns a specific value (-1) to signal an invalid input."
