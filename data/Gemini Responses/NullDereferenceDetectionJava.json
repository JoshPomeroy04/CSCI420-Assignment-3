    "R1": "You've hit the nail on the head! There is indeed a null dereference risk in your getLength method.\n\n\nIf the String object referenced by the variable s is null, attempting to call the length() method on it will result in a NullPointerException. This is a runtime exception that will crash your program if not handled.\n\nThe Risk:\n\n- NullPointerException: When you try to access a member (like a method or field) of a null object, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) throws a NullPointerException.",
    "R2": "Ah, yes, a classic concern for any seasoned Java developer! You've correctly spotted the potential for a NullPointerException right there.\n\n\nThe line return s.length(); directly accesses the length() method of the String object referenced by s. If, at the time this method is called, the s variable holds a null reference (meaning it doesn't point to any actual String object in memory), attempting to dereference it by calling a method will lead to the dreaded NullPointerException."
