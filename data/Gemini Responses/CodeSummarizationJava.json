  "R1": "This Java method, countWordFrequency, takes a List of String objects as input and returns a Map where the keys are the unique words from the input list and the values are their corresponding frequencies (how many times each word appears in the list).\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1.  It initializes an empty HashMap called freqMap to store the word counts.\n2.  It iterates through each word in the input words list.\n3.  For each word, it checks if the word already exists as a key in the freqMap.\n    If the word exists, it retrieves the current count using freqMap.get(word), increments it by 1, and updates the value associated with that word in the freqMap.\n    If the word doesn't exist, freqMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) returns 0 (the default value), which is then incremented to 1, and the word is added to the freqMap with a frequency of 1.\n4.  Finally, after processing all the words, the method returns the freqMap containing the word frequencies.",
  "R2": "As a seasoned Java expert, I recognize this countWordFrequency method as a concise and efficient implementation for determining the occurrences of each unique word in a List<String>.\n\nInternally, it employs a HashMap to store the word-frequency pairs. The method iterates through the input words list. For each word, it uses the getOrDefault method of the HashMap to retrieve the current count (or 0 if the word hasn't been encountered yet), increments it, and then updates the count for that word in the map. This approach avoids explicit checks for the existence of keys, resulting in cleaner and more performant code. The final Map<String, Integer> returned by the method provides a clear and readily usable representation of the frequency of each word in the original list. This is a standard and highly recommended pattern in Java for such tasks."
