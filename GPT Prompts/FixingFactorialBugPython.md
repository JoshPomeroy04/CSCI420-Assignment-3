# Zero-shot Prompting

## Input
    Fix the bug when input is 0:

    def factorial ( n ) :
        result = 1
        for i in range (1 , n ) :
            result *= i
        return result

## Output
The current implementation of the `factorial` function has a bug for input `0` because `range(1, 0)` results in an empty range, and thus it returns `1` by accident ‚Äî which *is* correct for `0!`, but the loop logic is off and will also produce incorrect results for other inputs like `1`.

Additionally, the loop should go up to and **include** `n`, not stop at `n - 1`.

Here's the **fixed version**:

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

Or, if you'd like a more compact and correct version that handles `0` and `1` naturally:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

Both work correctly for all non-negative integers. Let me know if you want a recursive version too.


# Chain-of-Thoughts Prompting

## Input 
    Fix the bug step by step when input is 0:

    def factorial ( n ) :
        result = 1
        for i in range (1 , n ) :
            result *= i
        return result

## Output
Let's fix the bug **step by step** when input is `0`:

### üîç Step 1: Understand the Bug

The original code is:

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        result *= i
    return result
```

#### What happens when `n = 0`?

- `range(1, 0)` is an **empty range**.
- So, the `for` loop **doesn‚Äôt run at all**.
- The function returns `1`, which is **correct** since `0! = 1`.

But...

#### What happens when `n = 1`?

- `range(1, 1)` is also **empty**.
- It returns `1`, which is **also correct**.

#### So what‚Äôs the problem?

The loop range is from `1` **up to but not including** `n`.

This means:
- For `n = 5`, it multiplies `1 √ó 2 √ó 3 √ó 4`, missing `5` ‚ùå
- The loop **never multiplies `n` itself**

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Fix the Range

We want to multiply from `1` to `n`, inclusive. So change this:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

To this:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
```

Now the function becomes:

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Test it

| Input | Expected | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `0`   | `1`      | ‚úÖ `1` |
| `1`   | `1`      | ‚úÖ `1` |
| `5`   | `120`    | ‚úÖ `120` |

---

### üéâ Final Version (Corrected)

```python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result
```

Let me know if you'd like a recursive version or one that handles negative numbers too.
